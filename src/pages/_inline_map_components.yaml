During Japanese rule, salt production expanded to meet industrial needs. Though large-scale salt production ceased in the late 20th century, the salt fields have become vital wetlands, supporting rich biodiversity and attracting migratory birds. Meanwhile, salt continues to influence local culture, inspiring foods like tofu pudding and "salted watermelon."
