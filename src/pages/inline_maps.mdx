    # Salt: A Small Material with a Profound Impact on Human Life
    
    <img src={salt.src} alt="image description" />

    What intrigued me to archive SALT is because it seems small, yet it impacts people and animals, even microbes countless ways. 
    To begin with, this picture In the article "As Ice Melts, the Inuit Strive to Keep Their Culture Alive" from Discovery Magazine (September 2019), an Inuit girl is depicted collecting and drinking sea water directly, confused me intrigued me.

    The Inuit people, indigenous to the Arctic regions, didn't historically use salt for food preservation, as their diet primarily consisted of fresh or frozen meat. However, this still demonstrates the essential biological need for salt, as it remains a vital mineral for bodily functions in all human populations, regardless of dietary or preservation. Thus, the relationship among sea, salt and human become my topic for the atlas.

    ## Global and Local - An Example of Salt and Town
    I start the whole story from a place that somehow we can say have “no salt,” and I want to zoom in the place with abundant salt to show the local effect of salt. 

    Take Qigu Salt Fields in Tainan, Taiwan as an example. The coastal areas in Tainan were among the earliest salt production sites since Han settlers arrived. During Japanese rule, salt production expanded to meet industrial needs. Though large-scale salt production ceased in the late 20th century, the salt fields have become vital wetlands, supporting rich biodiversity and attracting migratory birds. Meanwhile, salt continues to influence local culture, inspiring foods like tofu pudding and "salted watermelon."

    ## Epilogue
    Beyond its industrial value, salt serves as a bridge between ecosystems, culture, and heritage, leaving behind an enduring legacy of environmental and cultural significance.
